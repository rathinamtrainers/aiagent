# Project Plan: RAG Implementation and Vector DB Usage

## Key Features
- **RAG Implementation**: Applied to PDFs, audio, video, and text files.
- **Vector Database Implementation**: Also used with PDFs, audio, video, and text files.

## Points to Remember
- **User Interface (UI)**: Create an interactive UI for user engagement.
- **User Control**: Allow users to control whether the LLM (Language Learning Model) is automated or manually operated.
- **LLM Selection**: Let users choose the LLM, e.g., Grammarly or ChatGPT-like tools.
- **Memory and Custom Settings**: 
  - Retain user-specific settings such as coding preferences (favoring for-loops, multiple statements in one line, Python over C, file allocation, and hardware setup).
  - Store user-specific details like name, USN, roll number, and remember language preferences (age, demographics, etc.).
- **Privacy Considerations**: Comply with privacy laws and ensure user data protection.
- **Data Export**: Allow users to export their data for use in other systems.
- **Reference Projects**: Explore similar projects available on GitHub for reference.

## Project Details
- **Open Source**: This is an open-source project, not a commercial one.
- **Scalability**: 
  - Smaller versions can run locally.
  - Larger, scalable versions can be hosted on the cloud.
  - Scalability should be a high priority.

## Areas of Work
- **Front-End**: Development using JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.
- **Back-End**: Focus on LLM, Generative AI, Database Management, RAG, and Vector DB implementation.
