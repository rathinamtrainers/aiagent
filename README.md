# AI-Agent Application for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository contains the source code of an AI-agent application designed to support Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with extensive flexibility and extensibility. The system is capable of interacting with various data source formats, vector databases, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, it offers API and chat-based interfaces, and is customizable for new use cases.

## Features

- **Multi-format Data Sources**: The application supports multiple types of data source formats such as PDFs, text files, HTML, and more. It is designed to be easily extendable to new formats with minimal configuration.
  
- **Vector Database Support**: The AI-agent is compatible with a range of vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus). It allows you to plug in new vector databases to meet your specific needs.
  
- **LLM Flexibility**: The agent works with various Large Language Models (LLMs), including open-source and proprietary models. You can extend the application to incorporate new LLMs as they become available.
  
- **API & Chat Interface**: It provides both API and chat interfaces for interaction with the AI-agent. The framework can be extended to support additional use cases and interfaces.

## Use Cases

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for summarization, Q&A, and search across structured or unstructured data.
- Domain-specific LLMs for enhanced accuracy in specialized tasks.
- Build chatbots that leverage external knowledge to deliver more contextually relevant responses.
- Easily set up customized AI-agent workflows by adding new data formats, vector databases, LLMs, and interface endpoints.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent-rag.git
   cd ai-agent-rag
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
   VECTOR_DB_URL=your_vector_database_url
   LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### API

You can interact with the AI-agent through a REST API. Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/query \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "question": "What is RAG?",
  "data_source": "path/to/your/dataset.pdf"
}'
```

### Chat Interface

The application also supports a chat interface. You can extend this feature to integrate with various messaging platforms like Slack, Telegram, or custom chatbots.

### Extensibility

The application is designed with modular components for:

- **Adding new data source formats**: Implement new data handlers in the `data_handlers/` directory.
- **Supporting new vector databases**: Add vector database integrations in the `vector_db/` directory.
- **Integrating new LLMs**: Extend LLM functionality in the `llms/` directory.
- **Adding new use cases**: Define new workflows in the `use_cases/` directory, and expose them through APIs or chat interfaces.
